# Odoru - A Real-Time Dance Companion Web App

This repository serves as our group's submission to the HackWashU Hackathon 2024. This web app allows users to dance alongside a dancer video displayed in the web UI, while their movements are captured via a webcam. The app detects the user's skeleton in real-time using a computer vision model, compares their movements to the dancer's, and provides a time-based score based on the similarity of their skeleton moves. The scores are continuously updated throughout the dance session.

## Features

- Video Streaming: Users can select a dance video and view it while recording their dance through a webcam.
- Real-Time Pose Detection: The app uses machine learning and computer vision models to detect the user’s skeleton in real-time from the video stream.
- Motion Similarity Scoring: The app calculates scores by comparing the user's skeletal movements with the reference dance video, providing feedback on their performance.
- Responsive UI: The app provides a seamless interface for users to interact with the video, record themselves, and receive ongoing feedback during their performance.
